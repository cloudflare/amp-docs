# DEPRECATED - THIS REPOSITORY WILL NOT BE MAINTAINED AFTER AUGUST 2019.

AMPProject.org [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ampproject/docs.svg?branch=production)](https://travis-ci.org/ampproject/docs)
=========================

You're looking at the source code of the official website of the AMP Project. 
Even if you don't plan on contributing, explore how we've built the site for 
a good example of how to build a canonical, responsive standalone AMP site.

How to build the site
---------------------

### Install

Install [Grow](http://grow.io) and npm dependencies:

```sh
$ curl https://install.growsdk.org | bash
$ npm install
```

### Get a GitHub token or app id/secret

The docs in the reference section of the AMP Project site are not part of this repository; instead they are read from the [amphtml GitHub repository](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml) "source of truth."  When building the site these docs are fetched via GitHub.

Due to GitHub quotas this fetching will quickly fail unless additional information is provided in the request.  This can be either a personal access token or an application id/secret.

#### Personal access token

  1. Request a GitHub [personal access token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/).  Since the docs are fetched from a public repository you only need to select the "public_repo" scope when creating the token.  (It's a good practice to limit the token to the scope you need.)
  2. In your shell export the generated personal access token as `AMP_DOC_TOKEN`

#### Application client id and secret

If you prefer not to use a personal access token, you can also create a GitHub application and use its id and secret.

  1. Register for a [GitHub application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new)
  2. In your shell export the application client id as `AMP_DOC_ID` and the client secret as `AMP_DOC_SECRET`

### Build

```sh
$ grow build
```

This will generate a static, complete build of the site into the **build* folder.


### Develop

Note: Be sure to run `grow build` at least once to pull in reference docs before running the following command.

```sh
$ grow run
```

You can now open http://localhost:8080/ and continue working on the source files, then reload the page to see changes appear.
